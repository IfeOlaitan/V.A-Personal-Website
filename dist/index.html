                 <h5>FINDING THE SILVER LINING</h5>
                 <p class="paragraph">
                    In finding yourself, you need to be prepared for the good, the bad and the ugly that life will throw at you because it wouldn’t just be as a bed of roses or the walk in the park that you wish it would be. With this in mind, there is need to understand that after dark clouds and heavy rain, there is usually that beautiful ray of light, that of hope and remembrance that whatever happened prior is for the good to be revealed.
                    With 25 lessons, Finding the silver lining will take your through major experiences in the life of the author on her journey to finding the silver lining and she would love that you learn from it as well.
